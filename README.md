# Choose A Program
A helpful batch file for those who want to quickly perform actions on their pc.
Version numbers are not normal because i have done many revisions of the code over many years. I have since lost the old versions.

**Latest Public release build: V5.2

**Latest Dev Build: Currently out of date since it's V5.0 (Please use V5.2 Public release)

All Builds: http://www.mediafire.com/folder/m1716ed2gr8sw/Choose_a_program

Notice: This project is discontinued but will be reintroduced in the first release of a new visual basic program that is in the works called Program Launcher. With this new coding language i will have the ability to add way more features than i ever could with a windows batchfile. Stay tuned for any new repositories made by me.
